# Detection of computer generated papers using K-means and K-medoids
Data mining project
This Project is based on the paper "Detection of computer-generated papers using One-Class SVM and cluster" by Prof Zeev Volkovich and Dr Renata Avros.
In this project we used K-means and K-medoids in order to detect fake papers and real papers from a given papers.
